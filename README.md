# SQL:Employee Tracker

## Description
- My task was to build a database from scratch using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The application is able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company.
- I did not receive any starter code for this application. The application runs in the terminal using node.js
